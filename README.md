Technical Assessment for the Nomad GCS Software Engineering 1 position. 

Parameters: 
> Please don't spend more than two hours total on it and send back your response by EOD Wednesday 6.14.  Moreover, while the below is representative of the work we do at NTC, don't be discouraged if you're unfamiliar with the following specifics of React or Kotlin.  It's fine if your experience doesn't align with the below.  We're trying to establish a baseline.  

a)  Create a component in React with an input value of 10 (default), then keep this value in a state. Next apply the useRef function so a user can change the input value to 20. Consider using the Material UI Library, but not required.


b)  Make a slider bar using Material UI library and enable it so that a user can change the state. For example, when you move to the slider, the state value will changed. Make the range between 0 to 100.


c)  Convert the following into a functional component tsx file in React:
```ruby
document.querySelector(".input").addEventListener("input", event => {
                keyboard.setInput(event.target.value);
});
```


d)  Create a data class in Kotlin that is serializable with Kotlinx serialization and has an enum parameter.
